[{"content":"Taiwan remains one of Asia\u0026rsquo;s best-kept secrets. Whilst Japan and South Korea dominate Western travel itineraries, this island nation offers an equally compelling experience with far fewer crowds. This guide will help you understand what makes Taiwan special and how to plan your visit effectively.\nQuick Facts # Geography and Climate # Taiwan is an island approximately 394 kilometres long and 144 kilometres wide, situated roughly 160 kilometres off the southeastern coast of China. The island spans two climate zones: the north sits in a subtropical zone whilst the south enjoys a tropical climate. This means you\u0026rsquo;ll experience varying weather depending on where you travel. Central Taiwan is dominated by mountain ranges, with peaks exceeding 3,000 metres, whilst the western plains host most of the population and urban centres.\nPopulation and Languages # Taiwan has a population of approximately 23.1 million people. The vast majority speak Mandarin Chinese as the primary language, which appears on all official signage and government communications. However, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s linguistic landscape is richer than this suggests: more than 80% of the population can also speak Taiwanese, particularly older generations and those in southern regions. About 6% can speak Hakka, and indigenous communities maintain their own distinct languages (there are 15 languages except dialects)1. English proficiency varies considerably—you\u0026rsquo;ll find it more commonly spoken in Taipei and tourist areas, but less so in smaller towns and rural regions. The written language uses Traditional Chinese characters, which differ from the Simplified characters used in China.\nCurrency and Financial Practicalities # The official currency is the New Taiwan Dollar, abbreviated as NTD, TWD or NT$. As of October 2025, the exchange rate hovers around 30-31 TWD to 1 USD, though this fluctuates. ATMs are widespread in cities and accept international cards, making cash withdrawal straightforward. However, Taiwan remains more cash-oriented than many Western countries, particularly for smaller transactions. Credit cards are accepted at hotels, department stores, and chain restaurants, but night markets, local eateries, and traditional shops often prefer cash. Consider carrying a mix of both and withdrawing cash at convenience stores like 7-Eleven or FamilyMart, which house reliable ATMs with English interfaces.\nWhy Visit Taiwan? # Culinary Diversity Beyond Night Markets # Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s food scene deserves recognition as one of the world\u0026rsquo;s finest. The island\u0026rsquo;s history as a crossroads of indigenous cultures, Chinese migration, Japanese colonisation, and modern globalisation has created a unique culinary identity. Rather than simply seeking \u0026ldquo;the best\u0026rdquo; restaurants, understand the types of eateries available: breakfast shops (早餐店) serve morning staples like soy milk and egg pancakes; local diners (小吃店) offer authentic regional dishes in unpretentious settings; and night markets provide variety and atmosphere. The key is observing where locals queue during meal times—long queues at odd hours often indicate something special. Food here balances flavours differently than in Western Chinese restaurants; expect more subtle, layered seasoning rather than overwhelming heat or sweetness.\nAccessibility of Natural Landscapes # Taiwan packs remarkable geographical diversity into a small space. Within a few hours\u0026rsquo; travel, you can move from coastal cliffs to high-mountain forests to marble gorges. Unlike some Asian destinations where natural sites require extensive travel infrastructure, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s compact size and excellent public transport make outdoor experiences accessible even for non-drivers. The island maintains an extensive network of hiking trails with varying difficulty levels. What makes this special for Western visitors is the quality of maintenance and the relative ease of access—many spectacular viewpoints don\u0026rsquo;t require multi-day expeditions. Consider your fitness level and available time when choosing destinations: some trails suit casual walkers whilst others demand serious hiking experience.\nDemocratic Openness and Social Progressiveness # Taiwan stands out in Asia for its political and social environment. As a thriving democracy, the island has cultivated a society where diverse viewpoints coexist relatively peacefully. Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage in 2019, reflecting broader progressive values. This openness manifests in daily life: you\u0026rsquo;ll encounter vibrant artistic expression, political discourse in public spaces, and a general willingness to engage with different perspectives. For LGBTQ+ travellers especially, Taiwan offers a welcoming environment uncommon in the region. This social climate also translates to traveller experiences—locals are generally curious about and accommodating towards foreign visitors.\nEfficient Infrastructure with Cultural Authenticity # Taiwan achieves a rare balance: infrastructure rivals that of Japan or Singapore, yet traditional culture remains vibrantly present in daily life. The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems in major cities operate with impressive efficiency and cleanliness, yet step outside the station and you\u0026rsquo;ll find temples with active worship, traditional markets, and elderly residents practising tai chi in parks. This combination means you can travel comfortably whilst still experiencing authentic cultural elements. Unlike destinations where modernisation has erased traditional life or where lack of infrastructure creates travel challenges, Taiwan offers both convenience and cultural immersion.\nValue for Money # Compared to Japan or South Korea, Taiwan offers considerably better value whilst maintaining high standards of quality and safety. Your accommodation, food, and transport budgets stretch further here. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean Taiwan is \u0026ldquo;cheap\u0026rdquo; in absolute terms, but rather that the quality-to-cost ratio favours travellers. A meal at a local restaurant that would cost 15-20 GBP in London might run 3-5 GBP here, whilst maintaining excellent standards of preparation and freshness. This value proposition becomes particularly evident in accommodation and local transport.\nEssential Know-Before-You-Go # Visa Requirements # Citizens of 65 jurisdictions, including most Western countries, can enter Taiwan visa-free for periods ranging from 14 to 90 days depending on nationality. Most Western visitors (including UK, US, Canadian, and EU citizens) receive 90-day visa-free entry. Your passport must be valid for six months beyond your intended stay, except for US and Japanese citizens who only need validity for their duration of stay. Verify the specific requirements for your nationality before booking flights, as visa policies can change. Extensions are generally not possible for visa-free entries, except for Canadian and British citizens who may extend from 90 to 180 days under reciprocity agreements. If you plan work, study, or extended stays, arrange appropriate visas before arrival.

For perspective, this places Taiwan well ahead of Singapore (ninth) and Japan (tenth) in perceived safety. Violent crime against tourists is exceptionally rare. The primary safety concerns are more mundane: traffic accidents pose a greater risk than crime, particularly involving scooters. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s scooter culture means roads can feel chaotic to Western visitors accustomed to car-dominated traffic. Exercise caution when crossing streets—always use designated crossings and remain alert even when you have right of way. Petty theft exists but remains uncommon even in crowded areas like night markets; still, practise normal vigilance with your belongings. The greater risk comes from natural disasters: typhoon season runs from July through September, occasionally extending into October. If travelling during this period, monitor weather forecasts and be prepared for possible disruptions to your plans. Taiwan also sits in an earthquake zone, though modern building standards mean most quakes pass without incident.\nBudget Planning Framework # Rather than stating specific amounts (which date quickly), understand Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s cost structure relative to your home country. Accommodation ranges widely: hostels start around 600-800 TWD per night for a dorm bed, mid-range hotels run 2,000-4,000 TWD, whilst luxury options exceed this considerably. Food costs vary by venue type: convenience store meals cost 60-100 TWD, local restaurant meals run 100-250 TWD, and upscale dining starts around 1,000 TWD per person. Transport is economical: city buses and metro rides cost 15-30 TWD, whilst inter-city travel by conventional train or bus remains affordable. The High Speed Rail, connecting major western cities, costs more but still undercuts equivalent Western services. Entrance fees for most attractions remain modest, typically 50-200 TWD, with many temples and some natural sites free. Budget accordingly based on your travel style, but know that even mid-range travel in Taiwan costs considerably less than equivalent experiences in Western Europe, North America, or Japan.\nSeasonal Considerations # Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s climate profoundly affects travel experiences. October, November, and April generally offer the best weather conditions: comfortable temperatures, lower humidity, and less rainfall. The plum rain season from May through June brings persistent rainfall and grey skies, whilst July through September sees oppressive heat, high humidity, and typhoon risk. Winter (December-February) in northern Taiwan feels colder than thermometer readings suggest due to high humidity and lack of central heating. Southern Taiwan remains milder and drier. Choose your timing based on planned activities: if you want beach time, summer makes sense despite the heat; for mountain hiking, autumn and spring offer ideal conditions; winter suits hot spring visits and urban exploration.\nTaiwan\u0026rsquo;s Unique Quirks # Convenience Store Culture # Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s convenience stores transcend their Western equivalents entirely. 7-Eleven and FamilyMart outlets appear every few blocks in cities, operating 24 hours. These aren\u0026rsquo;t mere snack shops but rather comprehensive service centres. Beyond food and drinks, they offer hot meals, postal services, bill payment, ticket booking, ATMs, toilets, and even luggage storage at some locations. You can buy transport cards, arrange package delivery, photocopy documents, and purchase event tickets. The food quality often exceeds expectations—tea eggs, onigiri, and various ready-meals provide reliable, inexpensive options. Learning to navigate convenience stores makes independent travel significantly easier. They\u0026rsquo;re also air-conditioned refuges during hot weather and provide free hot water for filling travel mugs or instant noodles.\nScooter Culture and Traffic Patterns # Scooters dominate Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s roads to a degree unfamiliar to most Western visitors. Hundreds of scooters queue at traffic lights, creating a distinctive sight and sound. This creates specific traffic patterns: right turns (Taiwan drives on the right) at lights often have designated waiting boxes where scooters mass before the light changes. Pedestrians must watch for scooters even when crossing at designated crosswalks—riders sometimes fail to yield properly. If you\u0026rsquo;re considering renting a scooter yourself, understand that Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s traffic requires experience and confidence. For first-time riders or those inexperienced with Asian traffic, hiring a scooter may prove more stressful than convenient. Consider your comfort level honestly. Walking, public transport, and taxis often suffice for urban areas, whilst inter-city travel is well-served by public options.\nNight Market Experience # Night markets form an essential part of Taiwanese social and culinary life, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t uniform experiences. Each market has different characteristics: some focus on food whilst others mix in clothing, games, and household goods; some cater to tourists whilst others serve primarily local communities. Rather than seeking specific \u0026ldquo;must-visit\u0026rdquo; markets, understand how to evaluate them yourself. Large tourist markets like Shilin in Taipei offer variety and spectacle but also crowds and higher prices. Smaller local markets provide more authentic experiences with less English signage but better prices and more adventurous food options. Visit different types to understand what appeals to you. Arrive with an appetite but don\u0026rsquo;t eat a large meal beforehand—the point is sampling multiple small dishes rather than sitting for one big meal. Cash is essential, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need smaller denominations. Expect crowds, noise, and some jostling, especially on weekends. If you\u0026rsquo;re sensitive to strong smells, be prepared—markets combine cooking aromas, including some pungent offerings like stinky tofu.\nTemple Etiquette and Religious Sites # Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s temples remain active places of worship, not mere tourist attractions. Understanding basic etiquette shows respect and enriches your experience. Before entering the main hall, temples often have incense urns—locals purchase incense (usually a small donation), light it, and offer prayers before placing it in the urn. You\u0026rsquo;re welcome to observe or participate, but photography should be done respectfully and without flash. Shoes typically stay on except at specific shrines. Temples usually have multiple halls or shrines dedicated to different deities; locals often pray at several in sequence. The main deity occupies the central altar, with secondary deities in surrounding halls. Rather than rushing through temples like museums, spend time observing how locals worship—it provides insight into daily spiritual life. Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised to find locals burning joss paper (ceremonial offerings), shaking divination sticks, or leaving food offerings. These are normal practices, not performances for tourists.\nCommon Misconceptions # Taiwan versus Thailand # The similarity in English pronunciation causes genuine confusion, but Taiwan and Thailand share almost nothing beyond four letters. Taiwan is an East Asian island with Chinese cultural heritage, Mandarin language, Traditional Chinese script, temperate-to-subtropical climate, and an advanced technology-driven economy. Thailand is a Southeast Asian mainland nation with Thai cultural heritage, Thai language, Thai script, tropical climate, and a tourism-oriented economy. They\u0026rsquo;re approximately 2,400 kilometres apart with completely different cultural contexts, food traditions, historical backgrounds, and travel experiences. If someone mentions Thai beaches or Thai curry in conversation about your Taiwan trip, politely correct them—it\u0026rsquo;s a common mistake but one worth clarifying.\nTaiwan versus China # This comparison requires sensitivity as political tensions exist, but understanding the distinctions helps travellers navigate cultural and practical differences. Taiwan and mainland China share linguistic roots (Mandarin) and broad cultural heritage (Chinese), but 75 years of separate political development has created distinct societies. Taiwan uses Traditional Chinese characters whilst the mainland uses Simplified characters. Taiwan operates as a multi-party democracy with free elections; China maintains single-party rule. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s internet remains uncensored; China employs the Great Firewall. Different currencies, different governments, different passports—they function as separate entities despite China\u0026rsquo;s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. For travellers, this means: your China visa doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in Taiwan and vice versa; your VPN that works in China isn\u0026rsquo;t needed in Taiwan; the cultural atmosphere differs markedly, particularly regarding freedom of expression. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume experiences, expectations, or advice about China applies to Taiwan. They\u0026rsquo;re distinct destinations requiring separate understanding.\nSafety Misperceptions # Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s safety record sometimes surprises Western visitors who hold residual stereotypes about Asia. The island\u0026rsquo;s exceptionally low crime rates and high safety rankings mean you can comfortably explore night markets at midnight, walk residential streets after dark, and leave belongings at your table whilst ordering food. Women travelling solo generally report feeling very secure. However, this safety record doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean total absence of risk—traffic accidents, particularly involving scooters, present the primary danger. Natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes occur, though Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure and emergency response systems handle them effectively. The point isn\u0026rsquo;t that Taiwan is completely risk-free, but rather that the risks travellers face are different from what stereotypes might suggest. Violent crime, robbery, and aggressive scams remain rare, whilst traffic safety and natural disaster preparedness warrant more attention.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone Speaks English\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;No One Speaks English\u0026rdquo; # Neither extreme reflects reality. English proficiency varies by location, age, and context. In Taipei, particularly tourist areas, hotels, and restaurants accustomed to foreign visitors, you\u0026rsquo;ll find adequate English communication. Transportation hubs, museums, and major attractions provide English signage and often English-speaking staff. Younger Taiwanese generally studied English in school, though conversational ability varies. However, in smaller cities, local eateries, traditional markets, and with older generations, English becomes scarce. Rather than expecting everyone to speak English or assuming no one will, prepare for variable communication. Download translation apps, learn basic Mandarin phrases, carry your hotel\u0026rsquo;s business card with Chinese address, and develop comfort with non-verbal communication. Most importantly, understand that limited English doesn\u0026rsquo;t indicate limited willingness to help—Taiwanese people are generally patient and helpful with foreign visitors even when language barriers exist.\nTaiwan rewards visitors who approach it with curiosity rather than assumptions. The island offers a genuine alternative to better-known Asian destinations without sacrificing convenience or safety. As you plan your visit, remember that guidebooks and websites (including this one) provide frameworks, but your best experiences will come from observing, asking questions, and remaining open to discoveries. Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s greatest asset isn\u0026rsquo;t any specific sight or experience, but rather the combination of accessibility, authenticity, and welcome that allows travellers to create their own meaningful journeys.\nReference: https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%80%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"25 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/guide-to-taiwan/start-here/first-time-in-taiwan/","section":"Start Here","summary":"","title":"First Time in Taiwan?
